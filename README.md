# scs-m3-pandas-challenge

In this challenge, Pandas was used to alanyze the school data, aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## The analysis includes

* District Summary
  * Total number of unique schools
  * Total students
  * Total budget
  * Average math score
  * Average reading score
  * % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  * % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  * % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

* School Summary
  * Total number of unique schools
  * Total students
  * Total budget
  * Average math score
  * Average reading score
  * % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
  * % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
  * % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

* Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Math Scores by Grade
* Reading Scores by Grade
* Scores by School Spending

# Report

The district summary below showed that among 15 schools, the passing rate for reading is higher than the passing rate in math.

The school summary showed that the school that got the most budget did not have the highest overall passing rate which means that these results will affect the decision for budget priority.

Based on the analysis, the top 5 schools that have the highest overall passing rate are all Charter schools, and it is likely that they will get more budget.

Below are the bottom performing schools and they are all Distrct schools, it is likely that they will get less funding based on their overall passing rate.

Below is the analysis based on the spending ranges per student and it showed that more money spent on each student does not lead to higher passing rate for both their math and reading score.

The analysis based on school size, however, showed that schools with smaller sizes tend to have higher passing rates.

Lastly, the analysis based on school type indicates Charter school has a significantly higher passing rate compared to District school.
